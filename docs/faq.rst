Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================

Below are some common questions and answers about using deeprl. If you have additional questions, please feel free to reach out through our GitHub repository or contact our support.

**1. How do I install deeprl?**
   - You can install deeprl using `pip`:
   
     .. code-block:: bash

         pip install deeprl

     Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher and `torch` installed. If you encounter any installation issues, check the **Installation** section for detailed steps.

**2. What are the system requirements for running deeprl?**
   - deeprl requires Python 3.7 or newer and is compatible with major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows). Ensure you have `torch` and other dependencies listed in the **Installation** section.

**3. How do I create a custom neural network architecture?**
   - Create a new class that inherits from `BaseNetwork` and implement your custom layers and `forward()` method:

     .. code-block:: python

         from deeprl.networks import BaseNetwork
         import torch.nn as nn

         class CustomNetwork(BaseNetwork):
             def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
                 super().__init__(input_size, output_size)
                 self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 128)
                 self.layer2 = nn.Linear(128, output_size)

             def forward(self, x):
                 x = torch.relu(self.layer1(x))
                 return self.layer2(x)

**4. What should I do if I get an `ImportError`?**
   - Ensure that your Python environment is correctly set up and that `deeprl` is installed. Run:

     .. code-block:: bash

         pip show deeprl

     to verify the installation. If the issue persists, check your `PYTHONPATH` and make sure it includes the path to your project.

**5. How can I integrate my custom environment with deeprl?**
   - To use a custom environment, ensure that it adheres to the `BaseEnvironment` interface. Here's an example of wrapping a custom Gymnasium environment:

     .. code-block:: python

         from deeprl.environments import GymnasiumEnvWrapper
         import gymnasium as gym

         env = GymnasiumEnvWrapper(gym.make('MyCustomEnv-v0'))

**6. Why am I seeing a performance drop during training?**
     - Performance issues can be caused by several factors, such as:
     
     - Inefficient neural network architecture.
     
     - High resource consumption in the environment.
     
     - Suboptimal hyperparameters.
   
     Make sure to profile your code and experiment with different settings to identify bottlenecks.

**7. Can I contribute to deeprl?**
   - Absolutely! We welcome contributions. Please refer to the **Contributing** section for guidelines on how to submit pull requests, report issues, and propose new features.

**8. How do I add a new policy to deeprl?**
   - Extend the `BasePolicy` class and implement the necessary methods. For example:

     .. code-block:: python

         from deeprl.policies import BasePolicy

         class CustomPolicy(BasePolicy):
             def __init__(self):
                 super().__init__()
                 # Custom initialization

             def select_action(self, state):
                 # Custom action selection logic
                 pass

**9. How do I report bugs or request features?**
   - Please visit our `GitHub issues page <https://github.com/yourusername/deeprl/issues>`_ to report bugs or request new features.

**10. Where can I find more examples?**
   - Check out the **Tutorials** section of this documentation for in-depth examples and Jupyter Notebooks to help you get started.
